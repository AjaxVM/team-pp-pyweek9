As with all wars there are some happy endings, and some not...

Yours was a happy one, as was it for Chicken.
Not only did you destroy the mother-ship,
and thus halt any further invasions by the aliens,
but you also saved Chicken and won a few fancy medals...

And in case you were wondering...
Chicken is totally not on the dinner menu any longer!

Hmm - thought that was easy did you?
Well, if you haven't yet, try winning the whole thing...
using only the handgun! Yeehaw!
