You awaken in the middle of the night to a deafening boom.
Rushing to the window you see a freshly cut crop circle...

...right in the middle of your field...

Bewildered, and not the least bit happy,
you stare at it unbelieving for a few moments.
You know that whatever made that crop-circle cannot be good.

Then some movement catches your eye.
Your chicken is moving quickly towards the crop circle.

You rush out of your house to try and stop him.
But just as it reaches the edge of the circle it disappears.
You pause for a moment to consider your course of action.

In the end, the fact that that chicken was supposed to be
for dinner later forces you to continue following.

You reach the edge of the crop-circle,
right where your chicken entered, and step through.
A flash of green light jolts you, and you lose consciousness.

You awaken somewhere... else...
